ADDING NEW WORDS
________________

1) If you want to add new words to the word database of Vocab+, you can
   use the "Add Words" option in the Main Menu.
2) You will be asked for the word name, type and meaning.  Make sure that
   both the word name and type do not already exist in the database, as
   it is not allowed to keep two words of the same name and type.  If you
   attempt to do this, you will be warned against it.
3) In the "word type" field, you must select one of the options.  In case
   you are not sure about the "type" of the word you are trying to add,
   it is advisable to select "other".
4) While entering the meaning, make sure that you do not enter beyong the
   red line cautioning against the same.
5) If all the entries are successfully entered, a message saying the same
   will be displayed.  This added word can be viewed and verified using
   the "view words" option (see below).

VIEWING WORDS
_____________

1) To view a particular word, which you are sure of the name and spelling,
   it is faster to select this option.  Just enter the name of the word,
   and any matching entries will be displayed.  There could be multiple 
   matches (this will happen if the same word exists in the database 
   under different types).
2) If you are interested in doing a sort of revision of ALL words, it is
   best to select the "view all words" option.  All the words in the 
   database will be displayed in alphabetical sequence.  If it is not
   possible to display all words in a single screen, the "More" line
   will be displayed at the bottom.  In that case, you can press any
   key to move to the next screen.  Press 'Q' to quit the search, and
   go back to Main Menu.
3) If you are interested in viewing all words starting from a particular
   alphabet, it is best to select the "view single alphabet list" option.
   You will be asked to enter the desired alphabet, and all matches
   for the alphabet will be displayed as in the previous case.
4) If you are searching for a particular word, but do not know the
   exact name, you can select the "select word from all list" option.
   This allows you to quickly browse through the list of all words, and
   displays only the word name and type.  You can select a particular
   word for viewing by pressing the alphabet that is written in the "No"
   column next to the word, or scroll to next screen if the desired
   word is not found.  If you select a word, a new screen displaying the
   detailed word with meaning, etc., will be displayed.
5) If you are searching for a particular word, but only know the alphabet
   that it starts with, but do not remember the exact name, you can
   select the "select word from single alphabet list" option.  This 
   will ask for the desired alphabet, and will allow you make a selection
   as in previous case.
6) You can search for matching words by specifying a regular expression. 
   This feature is very useful if you remember only part of a word.  The
   two special symbols you can use are '*' and '?'.  '*' matches zero
   or more characters (any value), and '?' matches a single character.
   So, for example, if you can recall a word that starts with 'a' and
   ends with 't', you can specify the regular expression "a*t".  The 
   search will return all words starting with 'a' and ending with 't'
   and help you in locating your word.  Another example is that if you
   know that the first character is 's' and third is 'o', you can specify
   the regular expression "s?o*", which will fetch you the desired matches.

EDIT WORDS
__________

1) If you wish to edit the attributes of words, you can do so by 
   selecting the "edit words" option from Main Menu.
2) If you want to edit a particular word that you know the exact name
   of, it is best to choose the "edit particular word" option.  You
   will be asked to enter the name of the word, and if matches are
   found, you will select one of them (if > 1 matches are found).
   Once the word for editing is specified, you will be asked which
   attribute you would like to edit.  It is possible to edit any of the
   attributes, including name, type, difficulty level and meaning.
3) It is important to note that if the word name and/or type are 
   changed, and it is found that the new values clash with an 
   already existing word in the database, the editing will be aborted.
   This is because of reasons mentioned in previous section.
4) In case you are not very sure of the word name that you would
   like to edit, you can choose the "select word from all list"
   option or "select word from single alphabet list" option, if
   you do not know or know the starting alphabet respectively.
5) Once the desired changes are made, the "done" option must be
   selected to bring the changes into effect.  If successfully done,
   a message will be diplayed indicating the same.

DELETE WORDS
____________

1) If you wish to delete words from the word database, you can do
   so by selecting the "delete words" option from the Main Menu.
2) If you want to delete a particular word that you know the exact name
   of, it is best to choose the "delete particular word" option.  You
   will be asked the name of the word, and if matches are found, you
   will select one of them (if > 1 matches are found).  One the word
   for deletion is specified, Vocab+ will prompt you for confirmation
   if you are really sure you would like to delete the word :-)
3) In case you are not very sure of the word name that you would
   like to delete, you can choose the "select word from all list"
   option or "select word from single alphabet list" option, if
   you do not know or know the starting alphabet respectively.
4) Once the word is successfully deleted, a message will be displayed
   confirming the same.

VOCABULARY TEST
_______________

1) You can take vocabulary tests by selecting the "vocab test" option
   in the Main Menu.
2) Vocab+ provides a comprehensive set of vocabulary tests that you
   can take to enhance your vocabulary.  You can select the list of
   words that you would like to be tested by giving a particular
   alphabet, or choose to be tested with ALL words.
3) Also, you can decide whether the ordering of the tests should be
   alphabetical, reverse-alphabetical or random in order.
4) The random "learning" test type is one of the smart features of
   Vocab+.  This test dynamically learns how you are faring with 
   various words during the test taking process, and tries to ask
   difficult words (which you have failed in earlier) more frequently
   than easier words.
5) The kind of test can be selected among the choices available. You
   can be asked to select the meaning from a list for a given word, or 
   to select a word from a list, given the meaning.  Also, to go
   one step further, you can choose to be asked to recall the word
   itself, given just the first alphabet of the word and its meaning.
   A smart feature provided by Vocab+ is to allow you to select
   any of the tests above 'randomly', dynamically as the test is in
   progress.
6) In case of the tests for selecting a meaning or selecting a word
   from a list, you must enter the correct serial alphabet for
   the answer, and in case of the recalling the word type of test,
   you must complete the word after the first alphabet.
7) If you select the right answer or enter the right answer, your
   score is incremented, otherwise, it is not.  The current score
   is printed at the top of the screen, as well as the test number
   and the current pass percentage.  
8) You can review a word after taking a test for that word by
   pressing 'R'.  You can quit the test any time, by pressing 'Q'.
9) After you quit the test, your complete test summary that is 
   prepared by Vocab+ is displayed, with complete information 
   about how you fared.  This includes the total number of tests
   taken, the total number of tests passed and failed, and the
   pass percentage.  Also, the average difficulty of the words
   taken is printed, giving you a fair idea on how well you
   fared vis-a-vis the difficulty.  Also, and exciting information
   printed is the number of new words added to your vocabulary
   based on the results of the test, or those that you knew
   earlier but have now forgotted :-(.  Do take this feedback
   seriously, and you will be able to track your progress 
   effectively!
   
FLUSH CURRENT DATA TO DISK
__________________________

1) Vocab+ does not automatically synchronize the data that is 
   changed during runtime (for example, when you add, edit or
   delete a word).  Rather, it keeps the updated database in
   memory for performance, and does not keep writing to disk
   unnecessarily. 
2) When you exit Vocab+ gracefully, it does write back the 
   complete current database back to disk.
3) However, if you want to synchronize the disk with the current
   database (for example, after making several important changes
   that you want to get written immediately to disk, to obviate
   the risk of power failure, etc.), you can select the option
   "flush current data to disk" from Main Menu.  This option
   does exactly what you want - it synchronizes the current
   data in memory to the one in the disk.  (Thus the disk
   is updated with latest data).

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
__________________________

Q) I'm not able to run Vocab+ on my system.  When I run it, it
   doesn't display anything on the screen!
A) Probably your system does not support the screen based displays.
   Vocab+ requires screen based display support.  This is present
   in most modern X-window based unix systems.

Q) When I try to take the vocab test, it says "Not enough words
   in the database".  What does that mean?
A) This means that you do not have sufficient words in your word
   database.  You must have atleast TEST_LIST_MAX number of words
   of each type in your database, as this is required for generating
   sufficient choices for selection during the tests.  This macro
   is defined in word_types.h, and can be changed by you for your
   needs.

Q) I have observed a crash in the program.  What do I do?
A) That is not surprising, since I have written this in such a hurry.
   If you can give me the exact situation in which you observed the
   fault, please do write to me at software@gauravjain.in with the
   details, and I will try to provide a fix asap.

Q) I have a few suggestions for improvement of Vocab+.
A) Please mail me those valuable suggestions at software@gauravjain.in 
   and I will try to analyze them.  Thanks.
